    description: "The fifth-generation Renault Clio, unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, represents an evolutionary approach to exterior design but a revolutionary leap in interior quality and technology. Built on the CMF-B HS platform shared with the second-generation Captur, the Clio V is actually slightly shorter and lower than its predecessor but offers more interior space through improved packaging. The exterior design, under the direction of Laurens van den Acker and Pierre Sabas (exterior), maintains the previous generation's sporty silhouette with hidden rear door handles but features more refined lines, C-shaped LED signature lighting, and a more assertive front grille. The most significant changes are found inside, where a completely redesigned dashboard features significantly improved materials and finishes, a digital instrument cluster (7 to 10 inches depending on trim), and a portrait-oriented touchscreen (up to 9.3 inches) housing Renault's new Easy Link infotainment system with enhanced connectivity features including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Engine options include small gasoline units such as the 0.9 TCe and 1.2 TCe in various power outputs (75-130hp), a 1.5 Blue dCi diesel (75-115hp), and notably, the introduction of Renault's E-Tech hybrid system combining a 1.6-liter gasoline engine with two electric motors for a combined output of 140 horsepower and the ability to drive on electric power alone for short distances. Transmission options include 5/6-speed manual, 7-speed Getrag EDC dual-clutch automatic, and E-TECH multi-mode automatic transmission. Safety and driver assistance technology saw a significant expansion with available features including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, traffic sign recognition, blind spot warning, and automated emergency braking. The interior design was led by Magali Gouraud and features sporty seats and a redesigned steering wheel. Despite market shifts toward crossovers and SUVs, the fifth-generation Clio continues to be one of Europe's best-selling vehicles, appealing to buyers seeking a sophisticated small car with modern technology and efficient powertrains."

    description: "A significant facelift debuted on 18 April 2023, featuring a completely redesigned front bumper with slimmer headlights and a wider checkerboard grille. The R.S. Line trim level was replaced with the Esprit Alpine trim level, marking a shift in Renault's performance-oriented branding. The exterior updates include a more aggressive front fascia with the new grille design that echoes Renault's current design language. Inside, the facelifted Clio retains the high-quality materials and technology features of the original fifth-generation model while receiving incremental updates to keep it competitive in the supermini segment. The E-Tech hybrid system continues to be available, offering improved efficiency and the signature benefit of electric-only driving capability. The facelift helps maintain the Clio's position as one of Europe's top-selling vehicles, competing against newer rivals while leveraging Renault's established reputation for combining style, technology, and efficiency in the B-segment. In 2024, the Clio received an updated steering wheel with Renault's new logo, taken from the Symbioz model."
